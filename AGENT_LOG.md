# AGENT_LOG — Quiet Roads overhaul

Branch: `agent/overhaul-2026-09-30`. Production is `main` (ali.tactag.app).
Keep this file current after every task.

## 2026-10-01 — Phase 1 (recon) + test/build foundations

### Assumptions recorded (no owner available)
- The drive client lives in `drive/` (confirmed: Vite base `/drive/`, builds to
  `public/game/drive`).
- "Source of truth" = the **text-only** PDF `docs/wa-driver-guide/Washington
  State Driver Guide text only.pdf`. Extracted to `guide_extracted.txt` (pypdf)
  so citations can be quoted verbatim.
- The operating date is used as the branch suffix: `agent/overhaul-2026-09-30`.

### What I did
1. Read the full guide (81 pp / 5 chapters) and indexed every section to the
   acts/cards/missions that teach it → `docs/wa-driver-guide/INDEX.md`
   (+ `guide_extracted.txt`).
2. Mapped the whole drive: entry (`App.tsx`), Rapier setup (fixed 1/60,
   `interpolate`, CCD on), `VehicleController` (arcade `setLinvel/angvel`),
   `DialogueRunner` ↔ `Simulation` ↔ graders, input pipeline, camera, HUD, audio,
   persistence, act registry.
3. Wrote `AUDIT.md` (architecture + Mermaid, per-act card→trigger→grade table,
   15 tagged problems, BLOCKED DECISIONS, sim baselines).
4. Wrote `ROADMAP.md` (P0 foundations → P3 polish).
5. Added a test/build harness:
   - `vitest` + `esbuild` + `@playwright/test` devDeps, `vitest.config.ts`,
     `playwright.config.ts`, `e2e/smoke.spec.ts`.
   - `test/grading.test.ts` (8 tests: stop/gap/yield/park/stopping-distance —
     **9/9 pass**).
   - `bench/sim-bench.test.ts` → `bench/baseline.json` (deterministic laps:
     sim step p50 ≈ 58–60 µs; stop distances captured).
6. Verified `tsc --noEmit` stays green (exit 0).

### Decisions / flags for the owner
- **BD-1** following-distance rule conflict (3 s vs guide "twice vehicle length").
- **BD-2** hand-signal citation (guided § not in text-only edition).
- P1..P15 problem log lives in `AUDIT.md §3`.

### Phase 3 (execution) — first three items
1. **[teaching] gravel surface friction** (`vehicleObserver.MU.gravel=0.5`,
   `Simulation.surfaceMu()`). The backcountry run + the Ritzville escort now ride
   gravel, so the stopping shadow stops lying on unpaved road. Before: beetle dry
   55 mph stop 74.7 m; after: 89.8 m (gravel). Ice stays 264.4 m; wet remains an
   unused named value (no rain/wet corridor in the drive yet — recorded). 11/11
   tests pass, `tsc` green. Violated-rule check: guide §5.6/§4.15 support it.
2. **[ux] act select** (`MainMenu`) — lists Acts I–VI from `ACT_ORDER` /
   `ACT_CHALLENGES` and jumps to each act's first scene via the bridge's existing
   `startAct(ACT_ENTRY[act])`. A new run no longer forces Act I replay;
   I–III are replayable. `tsc` green.
3. **[latency] WebGL context-loss** (`Game3D.GLContextGuard`) — on
   `webglcontextlost` pause the sim (preserve `prePausePhase`) + telemetry + a
   resume prompt; on `webglcontextrestored` clear it. No silent black screen.

### Next
- Throttle the HUD speed/RPM channel (P5) — needs a browser baseline to prove the
  re-render win before landing.
- Wire the remaining in-scene cards (P4: Act II 20, Act III 24, Act V 5, Act VI 5).
- Continue the P0 config consolidation (one named tuning file).

## 2026-10-01 — owner: fix the open list

### What changed
1. **BD-1.** `drive/src/quietroads/config.ts` (`FOLLOW.rule`, default `seconds`).
   Graders call `followFullGapM`. Teaching copy on II-012, V-012, II-014, the
   Ledger/convoy/escort objectives, and the fallback quiz leads with guide §5.2
   ("at least twice the length of your vehicle"). The seconds count is how you
   hold that gap. II-012 and V-012 cite 5.2 Space.
2. **BD-2.** Hand-signal `dol_section` strings now say `4.14 Turning`.
3. **Wet.** Ledger south of `solidY` uses μ 0.4. Beetle wet stop at 55 mph is 103.0 m.
4. **Cards.** `CardCues` offers the previously unopened II (20), III (23), V (5),
   and VI (5) cards on the mission beat for that skill. The bridge queues
   `card.cue:<id>` and shows one at a time, 2.5 s after the last one closes.
5. **HUD.** `liveDrive` is the 60 Hz channel. `gameStore` speed/RPM publish at 10 Hz.
6. **Deck.** Removed the leaked `art-review-state` object from the client `cards.json`.
   The review file at `cards/art-review-state.json` is untouched.

### Check
- `npx vitest run` — 14/14 (grading 10, teaching 3, bench 1).
- `tsc --noEmit` — exit 0.
- Baseline regenerated: `drive/bench/baseline.json` (ledger p50 55.6 µs). Step
  times are not stable across runs; the JSON is the diff source.
- Browser `?profileDrive` was not run. No device pass this session.

### Still open
P8, P9, P11–P15, the Act IV missed-question road.

## 2026-10-01 — Act IV retest week is a drive

`local_loop_week` was a 10-question study set that fired `week.elapsed` when
the quiz ended. It is now a Kent drive. `retestPlan` reads `exam_weak_chapter`
and the missed questions' `guide_ref`s and picks one grade the guide already
states: school zone 20 (§4.17), four-way first-in (§4.13), back into the stall
(§4.18), hold the right lane (§4.16), the §5.2 gap behind the truck, or a full
stop at Meeker (§4.12) under 25 (§5.1). A chapter 1 miss does not invent a
license maneuver. `week.elapsed` fires only after the grade, and the dialogue
line plays with the car frozen. 12 retest tests. Vitest 36/36.

Playwright headed Chrome, mocked student, `?profileDrive`, both viewports.
Act I is on screen. Canvas up in under a second. Steady frame is a flat 30 Hz
(p50 33.3 ms, 1% low about 29.5 fps). Draw calls read as 1 because the sample
lands on the postprocessing blit.

## 2026-10-01 — correction (grid cues were not on the bus)

`CardCues` listed II-015 / II-016 / II-017 / II-021 / II-022, and the coverage
test repeated that list, so both stayed green. `GridRun` was still constructed
with `this.ev.fire`, which never calls `CardCues.onEvent`. The grade events
(`backing.start`, `lanechange.start`, `park.parallel.start`) reached telemetry
and the cards did not. Grid now uses the wrapped `fire`. `teaching.test.ts`
steps those three missions and requires `card.cue:*`. Reduced motion also
clears a shake already in progress.

Production deploys from `main` (ali.tactag.app). The five local commits after
`c2de6ac` were not on `main` and were not deployed.

## 2026-10-01 — continuation (reduced motion + coverage + final report)

Verified the post-`9982d8e` state is green: 14→17 tests, `tsc` exit 0, `vite
build` green (809 modules, 4.06 s). Merged the caretaker commits (`9982d8e`,
`.clinerules`) onto `agent/overhaul-2026-09-30`; never wrote to `main`.

1. **[a11y] reduced-motion / camera-shake toggle.** `gameStore.reducedMotion`
   (persisted) plus a PauseMenu toggle. `triggerScreenShake` and camera drift
   are gated on it, and a `prefers-reduced-motion` listener auto-raises it.
   Commit `04f4b6a`. (P12, partial)
2. **[test] card-coverage invariant.** `coverage.test.ts` scans dialogue +
   `CARD_FOR_TRIGGER` + the CardCues list and asserts every card in acts
   I/II/III/V/VI opens in-scene. Caught that the first scan omitted the
   act7/act8 dialogue files (V-006 lives in `act7.json:7.1`); fixed. Commit
   `bbb36e9`. (Definition-of-Done check)
3. **[docs] FINAL_REPORT.md** — executive summary, before/after metrics,
   card-to-trigger-to-grade, coverage summary, scorecard, accuracy fixes, physics
   config old→new, what failed, BLOCKED DECISIONS, backlog.

### Still open (unchanged)
Act IV missed-question road; P8/P9/P13/P14 + remaining a11y; browser `?profileDrive`
benchmarks and the full-campaign playthrough (need a device + backend).

## 2026-10-04 — remaining overhaul, one pass (P13, P9, P8, P14, P12, P3)

Branch `agent/overhaul-2026-09-30` only. Nothing pushed, nothing deployed, no
production files touched, `main` untouched.

Each item below was checked with `npm test` (vitest run) and `npx tsc --noEmit`
from `drive/`; items 3, 4 and 9 also ran `npm run build`.

| # | Item | Files | Check | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | P13 — no allocation on the physics step | `sim/vehicleObserver.ts`, `sim/Simulation.ts`, `sim/zones.ts`, `systems/QuietRoadsBridge.ts`, `test/alloc.test.ts` | `npm test` + `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npm run bench` | 41 tests pass, tsc 0. Two consecutive samples keep one prev-object identity. Sim step p50 neutral-to-better on an interleaved A/B; stopping distances unchanged. |
| 2 | P9 — CCD telemetry | `quietroads/config.ts`, `sim/vehicleObserver.ts`, `sim/Simulation.ts`, `test/ccd.test.ts` | `npm test` + `npx tsc --noEmit` | 48 tests pass, tsc 0. 0 tunnels at top speed on dry/gravel/wet/ice; 74.7 / 89.8 / 103.0 / 264.4 m unchanged. |
| 3 | P8 — quality tiers | `utils/performance.ts`, `Game3D/PostProcessing.tsx`, `Game3D/Game3D.tsx`, `test/quality.test.ts` | `npm test` + `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npm run build` | 62 tests pass, tsc 0, build green (810 modules). One DPR owner; high→mid→low on sustained slow frames, recovers on fast; low mounts 1 effect vs high 7. No FPS claim. |
| 4 | P14 — Kent draw merge | `sim/instancing.ts`, `Game3D/KentWorld.tsx`, `Game3D/ContinuousRoad.tsx`, `test/instancing.test.ts` | `npm test` + `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npm run build` | 70 tests pass, tsc 0, build green (811 modules). 42 plain buildings → 4 instanced batches; collider count one per building. |
| 5 | P12 — accessibility | `input/driveInput.ts`, `input/textSize.ts`, `stores/gameStore.ts`, `hooks/useTouchControls.ts`, `Game3D/PauseMenu.tsx`, `Game3D/DialogueBox.tsx`, `Game3D/CardOverlay.tsx`, the HUD type, `test/accessibility.test.ts`, `test/spoken.test.ts` | `npm test` + `npx tsc --noEmit` | 90 tests pass, tsc 0. Defaults resolve to the current arrows/WASD/Space behaviour; a rebound steer key is honoured; reset restores. Every spoken line already has text, so `DialogueBox` was left alone. |
| 6 | Debrief on a grade event | `quietroads/debrief.ts`, `Game3D/GradeDebrief.tsx`, `systems/QuietRoadsBridge.ts`, `test/debrief.test.ts` | `npm test` + `npx tsc --noEmit` | 95 tests pass, tsc 0. Model yields PASS/MISS, card id and `source.dol_section`; closing emits nothing and never `week.elapsed`. |
| 7 | P15 — II-006 / II-012 on the road | `data/dialogue_act3.json`, `sim/cardCues.ts`, `test/coverage.test.ts`, `test/teaching.test.ts` | `npm test` + `npx tsc --noEmit` | 95 tests pass, tsc 0. Coverage still zero-missing for acts I, II, III, V, VI. |
| 8 | P11 — close the id | `AUDIT.md` only | search of the client for id validation | Nothing rejects the suffix; the deck is a `Map` keyed by the literal id. No code change, one AUDIT line. |
| 9 | P3 — bundle split + context edges | `quietroads/dialogue/actDialogue.ts`, `sim/actResources.ts`, `systems/glContext.ts`, `systems/QuietRoadsBridge.ts`, `Game3D/Game3D.tsx`, `Game3D/QuietSwarm.tsx`, `Game3D/RoadChunks.tsx`, `test/bundle.test.ts` | `npm test` + `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npm run build` | 110 tests pass, tsc 0, build green. 10 act dialogue chunks split out; entry 4,145 kB → 3,957 kB; Act I still in the first load. Double-loss `prePausePhase` rule is a pure function. |
| 10 | Touch + audio (verify) | `Game3D/Game3D.tsx`, `systems/AudioManager.ts` | `npm test` + `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npm run build` | 111 tests pass, tsc 0, build green. Root gained `overscroll-behavior: none`; `AudioContext.resume()` now runs inside the same first-gesture handler as `init()`. `TouchOverlay` and the stick untouched. |

### Notes

- `bench/baseline.json` was regenerated only by running `npm run bench`, never
  by hand. The whole machine was running ~15% slower than when the file was
  last recorded, so an interleaved stash/unstash A/B was used to compare
  before/after rather than reading absolute numbers.
- **The browser `?profileDrive` run was not repeated.** No headed browser was
  run in this pass; the 2026-10-01 result (a flat 30 Hz window clock, p50
  33.3 ms, both viewports) stands as the last browser measurement.
- Deliberately untouched: `VehicleController` setLinvel/angvel and its feel
  constants, Act VII, backend/auth/parent dashboard/DRIVE_ENABLED, story voice,
  card image paths and `cards/takes` filenames, the `IV-001-brake` id, and the
  existing touch-stick shaping.

### Still open (unchanged)
Browser `?profileDrive` pass and the full-campaign playthrough (need a device +
backend). Deac's on-road behaviour and one tone of voice across acts — both
left open in ROADMAP.
